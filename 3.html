    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu" target="_blank" title="Cebu - Wikepedia">Cebu</a> is a province of the Philippines located in the Central Visayas (Region VII) region, and consists of a main island and 167 surrounding islands and islets. Its capital is Cebu City, "the Queen City of the South", the oldest city and first capital of the Philippines, which is politically independent from the provincial government.
    The Cebu Metropolitan Area or Metro Cebu is the second largest metropolitan area in the Philippines (after Metro Manila) with Cebu City as the main center of commerce, trade, education and industry in the Visayas. Being one of the most developed provinces in the Philippines, in a decade it has transformed into a regional hub for business processing services, tourism, shipping, furniture-making, and heavy industry.[citation needed] Mactanâ€“Cebu International Airport, located on Mactan Island, is the second busiest airport in the Philippines.
